Launcherfrien
=============

* This is the source for Launcherfrien, a launcher for the OSX EverQuest client to play on [The Al'kabor Project server](http://www.takproject.net/).

## History

* Originally, this was a program used to replace the official Sony launcher for the EverQuest Mac server of Al'Kabor. The Sony launcher was extremely terrible and I had always wanted a better solution.
* The EverQuest Mac server was shut down in 2013. On January 1st, 2014, an emulated server called [The Al'kabor Project](http://www.takproject.net/) debuted. Some members of the old Al'Kabor server now call this their home.
* Launcherfrien was converted to work with the new TAKP server.
