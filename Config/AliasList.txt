# AliasList.txt Notes
#
#   - Specify all of your account information here.
#   - Make a line for each alias as follows:
#        Alias Account Password DefaultSpace CustomConfigFile
#   - DefaultSpace will only be used if you are logging on more than
#     one account at a time.
#   - If you are using VirtueDesktops, DefaultSpace should correspond
#     to the respective desktop.
#   - CustomConfigFile is optional. If you specify a file name here,
#     I will look for that file in
#     “/Users/YourName/Library/Application Support/EverQuest/“
#     and copy it over eqclient.ini before launching that particular
#     alias. (However, this won't happen if launching multiple accounts.)
