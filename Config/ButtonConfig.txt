# ButtonConfig.txt Notes
#
#   - First, set up all of your account information properly in
#     AliasList.txt.
#   - Then, edit the values below. The format should be as follows:
#        Button#
#        Title of the button
#        The alias that the button launches
#   - The maximum amount of buttons you can have is 7.
#   - Buttons will only be drawn if you've changed their default title.
#     If you want to hide a button, change the title back to
#     "Button # Title".
#   - Remember, you can set up a button to launch more than one account.
#   - You will have to use the "Redraw Buttons" button in order for
#     changes in this file to take effect.
